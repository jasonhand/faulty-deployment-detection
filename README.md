# Faulty Deployment Detection - Interactive Demo

An interactive web-based demonstration of **Datadog's faulty deployment detection system**, showcasing their evolution from unsupervised to supervised learning approaches for automatically identifying problematic code deployments.

This demo is based on Datadog's comprehensive blog post about their journey to build an automated system that can detect faulty deployments within minutes, helping reduce mean time to detection (MTTD) and prevent incidents.

## üìñ What This Project Demonstrates

According to Google SRE, **deployments account for approximately 70% of incidents**. This interactive demo walks you through Datadog's approach to solving this critical problem through machine learning and statistical analysis.

### The Challenge

- **No Ground Truth**: Lack of labeled data for training models
- **Data Imbalance**: Faulty deployments are rare events
- **Diversity**: Different application profiles require different approaches
- **Time Pressure**: Need for rapid detection to minimize impact

### The Solution Evolution

The demo illustrates three main phases of Datadog's approach:

1. **Unsupervised Approach**: Rule-based statistical checks with iterative refinement
2. **Supervised Learning**: Sequential models trained on ensemble outputs for faster detection
3. **Weak Supervision**: Using multiple weak signals to generate high-quality labels
